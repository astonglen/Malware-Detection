# Malware-Detection
This project aims to develop a model using MLLib's classification models that predict whether a Windows operating system will be attacked by malware. The goal is to assess system vulnerability and identify and patch weak points before an attack happens. Model performance will be compared, and the project will be performed on PYSPARK on GCP.
